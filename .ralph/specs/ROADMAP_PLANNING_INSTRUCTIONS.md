# ROADMAP_PLANNING_INSTRUCTIONS.md – [PLANNING_HORIZON]

## Planning Scope

**Time horizon**:

- Short-term: next 1–8 weeks (MVP / early traction features)
- Medium-term: 2–6 months (core value loop, monetization foundations)
- Long-term: 6–18 months (scale, partnerships, deeper civic impact)

**Current project stage**: [e.g., pre-MVP / MVP built / early users / scaling]  
**Primary goals right now**:

- [ ] Reach functional MVP (petition builder + basic scorecard)
- [ ] Achieve first paying supporters (~$50k/year target in 4–5 years)
- [ ] Build trust & non-partisan reputation
- [ ] Other: [fill in]

**Constraints / realities**:

- Solo developer (you) + Claude assistance
- Center-right, Eisenhower-inspired, calm/non-tribal tone must be preserved
- Revenue via memberships, grants, Tangle News-style partnerships
- Tech stack locked: Next.js App Router, TS strict, Tailwind, MongoDB

## Strict Rules – Follow Exactly

- Think in terms of user value first, then technical implementation.
- Prioritize features that create a clear feedback loop (users act → see impact → feel motivated → subscribe).
- Avoid shiny / complex features that delay traction.
- Every item must tie back to one of: civility demand, legislation tracking, positive reinforcement, revenue, trust.
- Estimate effort realistically (XS = < 1 day, S = 1–3 days, M = 1–2 weeks, L = 3–6 weeks, XL = multi-month).
- Flag dependencies (data sources, APIs, design decisions, legal).
- Do NOT propose features that violate non-partisan stance or add political signaling.

## Required Output Structure

1. **Executive Summary** (2–4 sentences)
   - Current state snapshot
   - Recommended next big focus

2. **Short-Term Roadmap (next 1–8 weeks)**
   - Numbered list of features / tasks
   - Each item: Title • One-sentence value • Effort (XS–XL) • Priority (P0–P2) • Dependencies

3. **Medium-Term Themes (2–6 months)**
   - 3–5 high-level themes / epics
   - For each: Goal • Key deliverables • Rough timeline • Revenue / retention impact

4. **Long-Term Vision (6–18 months)**
   - 2–4 big bets / moonshots
   - Why each matters for $50k/year goal and civic impact
   - Major risks / open questions

5. **Risks & Open Decisions** (bullets)
   - Technical, user adoption, legal, data sourcing, etc.

6. **Next Immediate Action**
   - Single most valuable next step (usually one feature or research task)
   - Suggested branch name if implementation starts soon
